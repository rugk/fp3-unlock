# FP3 unlock

Generates the FP3 verify code for bootloader unlocking locally in your browser (the private wayâ„¢).

## Mirrors

If you don't trust this here, the same code should be mirrored at:
* GitHub: https://rugk.github.io/fp3-unlock/
* GitLab: https://rugk.gitlab.io/fp3-unlock/
* Neocities: https://rugk.neocities.org/fp3-unlock/ (updated manually)

You can also check that no network connections are made or just download the single HTML file and open it locally.
